### To train some foundatinal models for Indian languages with quality data that can be later fine-tuned for other purposes.

A repository for my experiments with Language models with different languages. Currently, I am focusing on Indian Languages, especially on Sanskrit, Hindi and Gujarati.

Goals:

- [ ] Train a models on languages separately
  - [x] Sanskrit
  - [x] Hindi
  - [ ] Gujarati
- [ ] Fine-tune it on a similar language for Language modelling
  - [x] Hindi -> Other regional languages
  - [ ] Sanskrit -> Hindi
  - [ ] Sanskrit -> Gujarati
- [ ] Train a multillingual model only with similar languages
  - [x] Sanskrit + Hindi + Gujarati
- [ ] Experiment with transfer leraning using Sanskrit as base langugage. (Need to work on tokenizer)
- [ ] Generative models?
